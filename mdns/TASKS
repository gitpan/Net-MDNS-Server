Tasks this library should support:

List all hosts supplying a certain service
Note that the above is roughly equivalent to "List all hosts on the network".  The hosts just have to be offering a service that you recognise.

Get the IP addrs for a host/service
List all services for a host - Not supported!
Get SRV record for a service
